# Theme\Plugin\WooCommerce

Improves compatibility of WooCommerce with other plugins. Currently, only compatibility with Yoast SEO is optimized.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require mindkomm/theme-lib-woocommerce
```

## Yoast SEO

- Filters OpenGraph type for product pages to be `product`.
- Adds additional OpenGraph price and availability tags for product pages.
- Adds OpenGraph tags for product category image if no special image was specified in Yoast settings.

## Support

This is a library that we use at MIND to develop WordPress themes. You’re free to use it, but currently, we don’t provide any support.
